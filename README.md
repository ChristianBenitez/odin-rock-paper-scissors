Steps involved in making project
1. Prompt player input for choice of rock paper scissors
    Player inputs choice in command line
    Player choice case sensitive so it can be written any way
2. Have computer choose one of the choices at random
    could have rock paper scissors equal to 1,2,3 and have computer choose randomly between those three numbers
3. Have system decide winner based off of both choices
    have to write if statements for all posible outcomes (rock vs paper, rock vs scissors, paper vs scissors)
